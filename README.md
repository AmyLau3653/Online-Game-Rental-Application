# Online-Game-Rental-Application
## Overview
This project aims to develop an Online Game Rental Application that allows users to browse and rent games through a user-friendly interface. The application utilizes PostgreSQL as the backend database for efficient data management and real-time updates.

## Features
- **User Registration and Authentication:**
  - New users can register and create accounts.
  - Users can log in and log out securely.

- **Game Catalog Management:**
  - Users can browse available games categorized by genre and price.
  - Search functionality allows users to find specific games based on various criteria.

- **Rental Management:**
  - Users can add games to their cart and complete the rental process.
  - Rental history and current rentals are tracked for each user.

- **Administrative Tools:**
  - Employees can manage game inventory, including adding new games and updating existing ones.
  - Administrative features include user management and transaction history.

- **Real-time Updates:**
  - The application supports real-time updates to reflect changes in game availability and user transactions using PostgreSQL triggers.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - Java for developing the user interface (UI) with a console-based client.

- **Backend:**
  - PostgreSQL for the relational database management system (RDBMS).

- **Database Connectivity:**
  - JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for connecting Java application with PostgreSQL database.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `java/`: Contains the Java source code for the console-based client.
- `sql/`: SQL scripts for database schema creation, data insertion, indexing, and triggers.
- `data/`: Contains data files used for populating the database.

## Acknowledgments
- This project was developed as part of the CS166 course at UC Riverside.
